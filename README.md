The project is a customer management application for the [COGIP](https://alice-becode.funquality.be/COGIP/home-body.html) company.

This __BeCode__ exercise is spread over 10 days and involves two teams: one __front-end__, the other __back-end__. A project manager is appointed ([Robin Jardon](https://github.com/Riojardo)) within the group to manage the whole.


## 👩‍💻 The team

This project developed in the __backend__ by [Robin Jardon](https://github.com/Riojardo) and [Alice Marique](https://github.com/Ecila83). The __frontend__ was developed by [Thomas Scozzari](https://github.com/Lomidou) and [Mathias Hardat](https://github.com/Seaandsurf).

### Back-end:
*The different parts of the exercise were cut out on a [trello](https://trello.com/b/IMvMDFih/projet-cogip) which Robin maintained throughout the 10 days of development.*

*As the Project Manager and PHP Backend Developer for this project, my responsibilities encompassed overseeing the project's development*
*lifecycle and implementing the backend functionality using [PHP](https://www.php.net). My role involved database manipulation, 
including insertion, updating, and querying data using [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/).*

*Despite limited availability due to illness, I contributed to [COGIP](https://alice-becode.funquality.be/COGIP/home-body.html)'s development by implementing crucial features, including database design, [MVC architecture](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Glossary/MVC), API routing, data retrieval via [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) queries, date formatting, deletion button functionality, and data limitation. Additionally, I handled the deployment on the server, ensuring accessibility for end-users.*

### Front-end:
*A [mokup figma](https://www.figma.com/file/PS5hPdhywkRfxreITOYwba/Cogip?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=XuAi34krO198iUdj-0) was provided for integration.*

*I worked on the front-end with [Mathias Hardat](https://github.com/Seaandsurf). Throughout the project, we worked as much as possible in pair-coding to be as efficient as possible. 
We thought about a "Mobile First" application, as any good front-end should, and then made it fully responsive.
A harmonious choice of colors and design, thanks to the creative talents of my colleague.
I increased my knowledge of [TailWind](https://tailwindcss.com) thanks to this job, and enjoyed working as part of a team.*

*On this project, my role was to design and recreate the [Figma mokup](https://www.figma.com/file/PS5hPdhywkRfxreITOYwba/Cogip?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=XuAi34krO198iUdj-0) as it was but with changing a little bit (only the main color to be honest)
We accomplished an amazing team work with my colleague [Thomas Scozzari](https://github.com/Lomidou).
The mornings were a bit slow, but the work was really efficient and we managed to finish all the desing and to make it responsive also !
This project was really interesting and self learning about Backend for myself!*
